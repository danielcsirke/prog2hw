- implement check wether the rgba values in class Pixel are in range 0<n<255 (comes from bmp standard)
- the getPixel method should return a const Pixel& object!!!
- the PictureManager class don't have to have a params struct, becase the filters vector holds the filterinstances, and they all have variables, that \
tell them how much they should apply values
- usage of std::unique_ptr<> and std::make_unique, and std::,,,_ptr<>m and make ... - handles dynamic data withhout me
- use a FilterFactory class which has static methods for creating instances of filters with required parameters
- filter classs should have neccessary data for applying it
